sumUpdater function: located in helperFunctions/index.js

conditional statements:
-I would like to update on click rather than updating with useEffect;
-This leads to state not being updated and comparing values as to what they
will be when they are updated;
-First if...else if... block
-checking if stateA or stateB is false && false or true && true.  Depending on 
if event.target.checked is true or false 
using tertiary operator solves this sequence.
-the first AND will use result of first XOR understanding that a false XOR means
that there was a true/false  combination in the previous state.  If checked = true, then it only means
that the new state will be true/true and will satisfy AND.
-Now determining the sum the XOR variable will be compared to the second XOR gate.
sum was initialized as false, so running only true conditions will suffice given that the other cases 
will equal variable sum's initialized value.
-The secondAND will be set to either true or false one satisfied condition
-the carryNext variable which will tell the next diagram whether it has a carry variable set to true or false;
